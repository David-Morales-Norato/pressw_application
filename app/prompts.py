Available Equipment: Pot, stove, strainer
Response:
---
I'll help you make perfectly cooked pasta using your available equipment.

Equipment Needed:
- Large pot (✓ available)
- Strainer/colander (✓ available)
- Stove (✓ available)
- Long spoon or tongs for stirring

Steps:
1. Fill your large pot 2/3 full with water (about 4-6 quarts for 1 pound of pasta)
2. Add 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the water
3. Bring water to a rolling boil over high heat
4. Add pasta and stir immediately to prevent sticking
5. Cook for 8-12 minutes (check package instructions)
6. Test pasta 1-2 minutes before suggested time
7. Strain in your colander when pasta is al dente

Pro Tips:
- Don't add oil to the water; it prevents sauce from sticking later
- Save 1 cup of pasta water before draining to help sauce stick to pasta
- Stir occasionally during cooking to prevent clumping
